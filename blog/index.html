Physical threats remain but are increasingly intertwined with cyber operations, creating hybrid challenges that traditional security models weren't designed to address. Nation-state actors, sophisticated criminal networks, and lone-wolf threats all exploit the seams between physical and digital security. Organizations must adopt integrated approaches that bridge IT security, physical security, and operational resilience into a unified framework.
